## Self-Evaluation: 
how many points out of 10 do you deserve on this assignment: I think I deserve 9 out of 10. I completed all the tests correctly but had trouble creating my own tests.

## Self-Reflection:
This assignment was something very new for me. I had some trouble downloading eslint but I think I got what I needed done correctly in it. This assignment showed a
few ways to test your program which was neat but it was confusing learning them all at once. I had trouble understanding it all and it took a while for each one. I did learn the different types of testing and cypress seemed very interesting.

### How long it took me to finish this?
About 3 hours.
